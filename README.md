## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you know the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, you should be able to add your flashcard set or modify an existing set and open a pull request, which I will take care of right away. Otherwise, you can prepare a file with the words you want added and send it to me. In either case, let me know at kielyphi@grinnell.edu
